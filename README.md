# Rock Paper Scissors in Python!
Very simple game I made in Python. Simulates rock, paper, scissors with you and the computer as the players.
Also allows for custom number of rounds.

This is a finished project so far. Fully functional game. However, I know my code is suboptimal and could(should) be updated. If you have any complaints send PR.

*Why doesn't Python pre-3.10 have switch statements :skull*
